  "e_text": "<p>Design input includes the voice of the customer, regulatory requirements, and information taken from similar product ideas.</p><p>While all of these are important, the most vital is the voice of the customer. </p><p>The House of Quality (HOQ) is a commonly used tool that captures the voice of the customer in the form of the customers voiced and unarticulated <strong>wants and needs</strong> and translates these into <strong>customer requirements:</strong> categories that reflect those wants and needs. 3M teams often use a streamlined version of the HOQ called the <strong>Linear House of Quality (LHOQ).</strong></p><p>Note that depending on your project or division, the HOQ or LHOQ may not be a required tool. However, if it is not, a similar tool for capturing the voice of the customer will be used. <strong>For the purpose of your learning journey, we will explore the LHOQ as our example.</strong></p>",
