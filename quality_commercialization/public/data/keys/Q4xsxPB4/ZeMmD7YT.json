This will be uploaded to the Design Qualification Matrix (DQM) task for the project in 3M | Grow at the end of each phase.</p><p>A DQM is required for all new product projects to document product requirements, design specifications, test methods, and traceability to verification and validation activities. While projects and divisions have some flexibility in implanting the steps used for completing the DQM, it is usually started <strong>once the 1st House of the HOQ is complete.</strong></p>"
